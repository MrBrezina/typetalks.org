## Accommodation ##

We do not assist with accommodation bookings, however here is a short list of hotels on various levels:

* [Hotel Jonathan](http://www.hoteljonathan.cz/)—comfortable family hotel located around 16.5 minutes from the venue (by public transport). It is the official sponsor of the symposium and offers 15% discount for all participants. Book via email (<info@hoteljonathan.cz>) and simply mention that you are attending TypeTalks symposium.
* [Hotel pod Špilberkem](http://www.hotelpodspilberkem.cz/cz/index.html)—central hotel in close proximity of the Brno castle and the venue
* [Hotel Avion](http://www.avion-hotel.cz/)—this central hotel is an icon of modernist architecture and one of the narrowest hotels in Europe, however be warned the accommodation is very very spartan.
