### Graphics in Focus: Communicating news and information visually

Information graphics have become cool. The internet is blossoming with blogs and other sites dedicated to visually mesmerising graphics. Unfortunately, often the visuals win over clear communication. Fancy graphics can be like blurry photographs: they might be artistic but information is lost in them. This workshop concentrates on keeping the graphics “in focus”, clear and communicative. The starting point is the information, not the visual. Once you learn to handle the information properly, only then should you give it a stunning design. This is essentially the core of information design.

The workshop will offer an overview of the theories and literature of information graphics and hands-on project. It will teach skills essential for working with information graphics. These skills include not just using the graphics software but also understanding and handling the data as well as interacting with the experts who provide it.
