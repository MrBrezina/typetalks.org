## TypeTalks 3<br />Brno, 6–7 September 2013 ##

The two-day symposium was held on **6–7 September 2013, in Brno**.

*In its third edition, the TypeTalks symposium is coming back to its hometown, Brno. Expect great atmosphere, a small event with friendly colleagues, and great speakers who have something to say. A day full of proper lectures will be preceded by an ultrademocratic evening of extrashort presentations (aka TypeShorts™) and an infodesign workshop. The conference is international in its scope and a great majority of the speakers will present in English.*
