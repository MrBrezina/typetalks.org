### About TypeTalks ###

*Typefaces and textual information in general, despite their crucial importance to our culture and development, are often neglected when it comes to visual communication and graphic design. This problem is particularly acute in the Central European, post-communist environment. TypeTalks was founded by [David Březina](http://davi.cz) as a collaborative activity designed to raise awareness of the power of typeface design and typography among both graphic design professionals and students.*
