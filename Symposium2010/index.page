## TypeTalks Brno, 21 June 2010 ##

The one-day symposium took place in **Brno, Czech Republic in the [House of the Lords of Kunštát](Venue.html) on 21 June 2010**.

*The theme of this conference is type. This is a broad area embracing the history of type, the design of type, type education, the use of type (typography) and much more. The key criteria for the acceptance of a talk is that it have educational value. It is not enough to simply show work, knowledge must be shared as well. Indeed, TypeTalks' reason for existing is the pleasure taken in learning and in sharing knowledge.*

### Brno Biennial ###

It is no accident that TypeTalks symposium is happening one day before the opening of the [24th International Biennial of Graphic Design Brno 2010](http://www.moravska-galerie.cz/en/biennial/24th-international-biennial-of-graphic-design-brno-2010/) and two days before the [Biennial symposium](http://www.moravska-galerie.cz/en/biennial/24th-international-biennial-of-graphic-design-brno-2010/symposium/)  starts. By this cunning plan we hope to attract more participants to come and enjoy typography, graphic design, as well as the city of Brno. We do not want to compete, we want to complement.
